      "At TU Dresden, we juggle OPAL, Selma, Hisqis, and Outlook every day, wasting time and fraying our nerves in the process. So we asked ourselves: Can't this be done more easily? This question gave rise to TUfast. It started as a small side project during our studies, then grew into a platform that quickly reached more and more students. What began with a few lines of code became a shared mission: to make everyday digital life at TU Dresden easier.",
      "Today, TUfast is an open-source project run by students and alumni of TU Dresden. It is used by over 4,000 students at TU Dresden. Everyone involved in the project does so on a voluntary basis and with the desire to make online teaching a little easier for other students.",
      "The project is supported by, among others, the [DigitalAcceleratorProgramm des Stifterverbands](https://www.stifterverband.org/digitalchangemaker-accelerator), the [output.dd project show](https://output-dd.de/blog/project-post/tufast-tu-dresden-2/) of the Faculty of Computer Science, several student councils at TU Dresden, and generous sponsors on [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/olihausdoerfer). We are not there yet: Our next step is to further expand TUfast—for TU Dresden, for other universities in Saxony, and for anyone who needs a little more structure and ease in digital teaching.",
